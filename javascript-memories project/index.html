                <p>
                    I am lachimolala, a proud member of the BTS Army.
                    My journey with BTS began in 2020, when I first heard 
                    their music and was captivated by their incredible talent
                    and heartfelt lyrics. <br> Each song resonates deeply with 
                    me, offering comfort and inspiration during both the
                    highs and lows of life.
                    BTS isn't just a music group to me; they are a source of
                    positivity and strength. <br> Their messages of self-love, 
                    resilience, and unity have empowered me to embrace my
                    true self and chase my dreams. From the unforgettable
                    concerts to the beautiful moments shared with <br>fellow 
                    ARMY members, every experience has created cherished 
                    memories that I hold dear. Through this website, I want
                    to share my favorite moments, songs, and memories as a
                    dedicated ARMY member. Join me in celebrating the 
                    incredible journey of BTS and the love we all share
                    for this amazing group! <br>

            <h2>How the UN speech by RM changed my life.</h2>
            <p>
                On September 24, 2018, Kim Namjoon, also known as RM,
                 stood before the United Nations as the leader of BTS 
                 and delivered a speech that not only touched the world 
                 but deeply impacted my own life. I can vividly recall 
                 watching him speak, his words reaching straight into my 
                 heart, igniting emotions and reflections I had long kept 
                 buried. <br> <br> "Speak yourself." These two simple words became 
                 the foundation of RM's message, but they carried a powerful 
                 meaning that I hadn’t fully grasped until that moment. 
                 For years, I struggled with accepting who I truly was. 
                 I was afraid of judgment, criticism, and rejection, so I 
                 chose to stay silent about my thoughts and feelings. But 
                 hearing RM, someone I admired, stand confidently in front 
                 of world leaders and youth alike, encouraging everyone to 
                 embrace who they are and to speak their truth, planted a 
                 seed of change in me.RM’s speech was more than just words—
                 it was an invitation to accept myself, flaws and all. <br> <br>
                  When he said, “I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear 
                 your conviction, no matter who you are, where you're from, 
                 your skin color, gender identity—speak yourself,” I felt 
                 for the first time that my voice had value. It wasn’t just 
                 about being heard by others, but about hearing myself, 
                 acknowledging my inner thoughts, dreams, and feelings, 
                 and having the courage to express them. <br> <br> After watching 
                 the speech, I made a conscious decision to step out of 
                 my comfort zone. I started to pursue my passions without 
                 the fear of judgment holding me back. I learned that it 
                 was okay to make mistakes, as long as I stayed true to 
                 myself. RM’s message helped me realize that vulnerability 
                 is not a weakness but a strength, and that self-love begins 
                 with accepting and expressing the most authentic version of 
                 oneself.Through this journey of self-acceptance, I’ve grown 
                 into a more confident person. <br> <br> RM’s words gave 
                 me the strength to chase after my dreams, unapologetically. 
                 Whether it's in my relationships, career choices, or creative 
                 pursuits, I’ve learned to speak myself and be proud of the person 
                 I am becoming."No matter who you are, where you’re from, 
                 your skin color, gender identity, just speak yourself. 
                 " These words have been my guiding light ever since. 
                 <br> <br> They remind me that my voice matters, that I matter, and 
                 that I deserve to live a life that reflects my true self. 
                 RM’s UN speech didn’t just inspire me; it transformed me, 
                 and for that, I will forever be grateful. <br>

            <p>
                The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1," released in 2015, 
                holds a special place in my heart as my favorite BTS album. 
                This album beautifully encapsulates the essence of youth, 
                capturing the highs and lows of growing up. Each track resonates 
                with personal experiences, making it relatable and impactful.One 
                of the standout aspects of this album is its exploration of themes 
                like love, loss, and self-discovery. <br> <br> Songs like "I Need U" and 
                "Dope" strike a perfect balance between energetic beats and heartfelt 
                lyrics, evoking a sense of nostalgia while urging listeners to embrace 
                the struggles of youth. The music video for "I Need U" vividly portrays 
                the chaos and emotional turmoil of adolescence, further enhancing the 
                connection to the songs.The production quality and diverse musical 
                styles also make this album shine. <br> <br>From hip-hop to ballads, each track 
                showcases the members' versatility and growth as artists. The inclusion 
                of unique soundscapes and thoughtful instrumentation creates an immersive 
                experience, allowing listeners to journey through the narrative of youth. 
                Moreover, the album’s artwork and concept resonate deeply with the themes 
                of fleeting moments and memories. It reminds us to cherish every experience, 
                no matter how small. BTS's ability to convey such profound emotions through 
                their music is what makes "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1" not 
                just an album, but a cherished soundtrack to my life. This collection of 
                songs continues to inspire and uplift me, making it a timeless favorite.

            <h2>My thoughts on 2025 reunion.</h2>
            <p>
                As the 2025 reunion approaches, I can’t help but feel a mix of
                 excitement, nostalgia, and hope. BTS has been such a big part
                of my life, and knowing that they’ll come together again after
                their individual journeys feels like a dream come true. Over
                the years, each member has grown in incredible ways, exploring
                solo projects and discovering new passions. While it’s been 
                inspiring to see their personal growth, there’s something magical
                about BTS as a group that is truly irreplaceable.The thought of
                seeing RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook on stage together
                again fills my heart with so much joy. The energy and connection they 
                share as a group have always made their performances unforgettable.
                I know 2025 will be a monumental year for BTS and ARMY.For ARMYs worldwide,
                this reunion will be a celebration of everything we’ve been throug
                together—the highs, the challenges, and the memories we've built. I’m 
                looking forward to seeing what new music, stories, and moments they’ll

            <h2>My Message to bts and armies</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with "Boy With Luv," a song that instantly captured
                my heart and opened the door to a journey I never expected. Your
                hard work, consistency, and success have been a constant source of
                inspiration for me. Watching you chase your dreams with unwavering
                passion has pushed me to work harder and believe in myself.The 
                comfort you brought me during the lockdown is something I will
                cherish forever. In those lonely, uncertain times, your music
                felt like a warm embrace, reminding me that it's okay to take 
                a moment, breathe, and believe that better days are ahead.
                The lyrics of "2! 3!" will always hold a special place in my heart,
                reminding me that after every storm, there’s hope. For the past four
                years, you’ve been my strength, my joy, and my motivation. Every song, 
                every performance, and every moment shared has shaped a part of me.
                Thank you, BTS, for being my constant source of light. These memories
                will always remind me that no matter how tough life gets, I’m never alone. <br>

            <h2>Thank you Armies and BTS</h2>
            <p>
                I can’t express enough gratitude for both BTS and ARMY. BTS, 
                your music has been a source of strength and comfort during my 
                toughest times. Your messages of self-love, resilience, and 
                unity have inspired me to keep pushing forward and chase my dreams.
                 Each member—RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—has
                  shown me the value of hard work and humility.To ARMY, thank you
                   for being such a loving, supportive community. We come from 
                   different backgrounds, but BTS unites us in ways that go beyond 
                   just being fans. The friendships and solidarity I’ve found here
                   are truly priceless. <br> BTS and ARMY, you’ve both changed my 
                   life in unforgettable ways. I’m excited to continue this journey
                    together. Borahae, always and forever.
